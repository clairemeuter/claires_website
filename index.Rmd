My name is Claire Meuter and I'm an environmental data scientist interested in using data analysis and visualization to explore the diverse ecological, economic, and social challenges facing our planet.
I am especially passionate about land planning and conservation, and using data science and visualization to inform conservation decisions. 

I am currently a second-year MESM student at the UCSB Bren School.
